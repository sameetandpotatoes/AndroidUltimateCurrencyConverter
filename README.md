#Purpose
  The purpose of this Android app was to convert between 300 different types of currencies. These currencies were retrieved from an API that contained a JSON file with over 300 updated, real-time currency rates. The app parses the JSON file and uses this file to provide accurate, real-time updates of currencies on a phone running Android OS.
